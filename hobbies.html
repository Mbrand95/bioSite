<p>Sarah is an extremely talented and multi-faceted artest who can adapt to any style. In her free time Sarah says:</p>
<p> "My hobbies typically align with something creative or that inspires me, like watching film and tv or playing video games, or reading comics. I’m also slowly getting into taking care of plants, but my first and only plant is barely alive, so I don’t think I’m that great at it yet."</p>
