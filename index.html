<p>My sister, Sarah, is a multi-talented, artistically gifted person. For as long as I can remember, she always had a pencil and paper in hand to draw something. This early childhood hobby has become a talent that has expanded and is now her career. Sarah went to Savannah College of Art and Design, studying Sequential Art with a minor in storyboarding. She’s gone on to brave an ever-changing, hard-to-navigate field and has done so well for herself. When asked what her biggest accomplishment was, she said: </p>

<p>“That’s a difficult question. I’ve had a lot of great accomplishments in my life, but I’m always striving to reach the next level, and when I’ve finished that achievement. I don’t spend much time basking in the accomplishment because I’m already prepared for the next step. However, last year I worked on a show as a storyboard artist that finally had its premiere a few months ago, and it was super exciting to see my work come to life!” </p>

<p>As I mentioned, Sarah has always had an interest in the arts. She’s been collecting art books since we were teenagers. She, along with some of her friends, made a whole comic as well! I asked her what her biggest motivators were, and she said, “My close friends and family are definitely my biggest pushers to keep me motivated, but my drive to prove myself is what keeps me going. I want to prove to myself and everyone around me that I can be successful and have a fulfilling career and personal life. There’s nothing better than happiness and success in the face of people who don’t believe in you."
